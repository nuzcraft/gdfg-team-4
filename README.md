## How to Contribute

Check out this [Cheat Sheet](https://education.github.com/git-cheat-sheet-education.pdf) for git commands

1. install git on your machine
2. using the command line `git clone https://github.com/nuzcraft/gdfg-team-4.git` to get a copy of the code repository
3. `git pull` to _pull_ the most recent changes down from github to your machine
4. `git branch new-branch-name` to create a new branch to work from
5. `git add *` to add all new changes so they can be committed
6. `git commit -m "message"` to commit any added changes to to the branch
7. `git push` to push your changes up to github
    - if the branch does not exist on github yet, `git push --set-upstream origin new-branch-name` will do the trick
8. if changes are good to merge into the project, create a pull request in github to merge your branch into the `main` branch
    - the `main` branch is our good code
9. back on your machine, `git switch main` or `git checkout main` to switch back to the `main` branch
    - `git pull` to make sure you have the most recent changes, then repeat the cycle
